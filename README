NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - Add an $AUTHORITY to your packages

VERSION
      This document describes v1.001 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - released December 07, 2010 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Authority.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin adds the $AUTHORITY marker to your packages. Also, it can
    add the authority information to the metadata, if requested.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [Authority]
            authority = cpan:APOCAL
            do_metadata = 1

    The resulting hunk of code would look something like this:

            BEGIN {
              $Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
            }

    This code will be added to any package declarations in your perl files.

ATTRIBUTES
  authority
    The authority you want to use. It should be something like
    "cpan:APOCAL".

    Defaults to the username set in the %PAUSE stash in the global
    config.ini or dist.ini ( Dist::Zilla v4 addition! )

  do_metadata
    A boolean value to control if the authority should be added to the
    metadata. ( META.yml or META.json )

    Defaults to true.

    The metadata will look like this:

            x_authority => 'cpan:APOCAL'
