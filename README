NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - Add the $AUTHORITY variable and
    metadata to your distribution

VERSION
      This document describes v1.003 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - released February 04, 2011 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Authority.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin adds the authority data to your distribution. It adds the
    data to your modules and metadata. Normally it looks for the PAUSE
    author id in your Dist::Zilla configuration. If you want to override it,
    please use the 'authority' attribute.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [Authority]

    This code will be added to any package declarations in your perl files:

            BEGIN {
              $Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
            }

    Your metadata ( META.yml or META.json ) will have an entry looking like
    this:

            x_authority => 'cpan:APOCAL'

ATTRIBUTES
  authority
    The authority you want to use. It should be something like
    "cpan:APOCAL".

    Defaults to the username set in the %PAUSE stash in the global
    config.ini or dist.ini ( Dist::Zilla v4 addition! )

    If you prefer to not put it in config/dist.ini you can put it in
    "~/.pause" just like Dist::Zilla did before v4.

  do_metadata
    A boolean value to control if the authority should be added to the
    metadata.

    Defaults to true.

  do_munging
    A boolean value to control if the $AUTHORITY variable should be added to
    the modules.

    Defaults to true.
