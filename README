NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - Add the $AUTHORITY variable and
    metadata to your distribution

VERSION

      This document describes v1.009 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority - released October 27, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Authority.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin adds the authority data to your distribution. It adds the
    data to your modules and metadata. Normally it looks for the PAUSE
    author id in your Dist::Zilla configuration. If you want to override
    it, please use the 'authority' attribute.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [Authority]

    This code will be added to any package declarations in your perl files:

            our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';

    Your metadata ( META.yml or META.json ) will have an entry looking like
    this:

            x_authority => 'cpan:APOCAL'

ATTRIBUTES

 authority

    The authority you want to use. It should be something like cpan:APOCAL.

    Defaults to the username set in the %PAUSE stash in the global
    config.ini or dist.ini ( Dist::Zilla v4 addition! )

    If you prefer to not put it in config/dist.ini you can put it in
    "~/.pause" just like Dist::Zilla did before v4.

 do_metadata

    A boolean value to control if the authority should be added to the
    metadata.

    Defaults to true.

 do_munging

    A boolean value to control if the $AUTHORITY variable should be added
    to the modules.

    Defaults to true.

 locate_comment

    A boolean value to control if the $AUTHORITY variable should be added
    where a # AUTHORITY comment is found. If this is set then an
    appropriate comment is found, and our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:PAUSEID'; is
    inserted preceding the comment on the same line.

    This basically implements what OurPkgVersion does for PkgVersion.

    Defaults to false.

    NOTE: If you use this method, then we will not use the pkg style of
    declaration! That way, we keep the line numbering consistent.

 authority_style

    A value to control the type of the $AUTHORITY declaration. There are
    two styles: 'pkg' or 'our'. In the past this module defaulted to the
    'pkg' style but due to various issues 'our' is now the default. Here's
    what both styles would look like in the resulting code:

            # pkg
            BEGIN {
                    $Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Authority::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
            }
    
            # our
            our $AUTHORITY = 'cpan:APOCAL';
